## About the Project

The Hamster ABM project aims to simulate the behaviors and interactions of hamsters in various environments to study their social structures, movement patterns, and overall ecosystem impact. This model is implemented using NetLogo, allowing for interactive exploration and analysis.

We encourage you to download our models and scripts to see the detailed workings and to contribute by providing feedback or enhancements to our project.
